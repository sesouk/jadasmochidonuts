    <p className='about__text'>Jadaâ€™s passion for baking started when she was just 6 years old. She used to ask for baking supplies when asked what she wanted for birthdays and holidays. While most other kids were playing with toys, Jada was baking a variety of goodies to share with family and friends. Jada just started her junior year of high school, and we started this business as a way to help her raise money for her upcoming cheer season. We never anticipated all of the love and support, but we are very grateful! We canâ€™t wait to continue sharing the love through our mochi donuts ðŸ’œ</p>
